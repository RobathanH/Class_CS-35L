C-M-a: beginning-of-defun: Moves pointer to the beginning of the 
current function definition
C-M-b: backward-sexp: Moves backwards over a balanced expression
C-M-c: exit-recursive-edit: Exits editing that is happening while a command
is running
C-M-d: down-list: Moves down in a paranthetical grouping
C-M-e: end-of-defun: Moves pointer to the end of the current function 
definition
C-M-f: forward-sexp: Moves forwards over a balanced expression
C-M-g: C-g: keyboard-quit: Get's rid of a partially typed command, or safely 
stops a running command
C-M-h: mark-defun: Selects the current defun, for killing, etc
Emacs Commands: 'C-h c <cmd-keystroke>', 'C-h F <cmd-name>'

13. If emacs is waiting for input, 'C-g' executes keyboard-quit. If not, the 
keystroke sets the variable 'quit-flag' to 't' as soon as 'C-g' is typed. This
is checked frequently and will cause the running program to quit relatively 
safely. If 'C-g' is typed a second time before the first is processed, emacs 
does an emergency escape and returns you to the shell.
Emacs Commands: 'C-h c <cmd-keystrokes>', 'C-h F <cmd-name>'

14. The emacs 'yank' function pastes the most recently 'killed' ('C-k') text
