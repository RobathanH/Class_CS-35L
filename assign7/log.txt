Connecting to BeagleBone:
-Since I'm running linux, I don't need to install any drivers, and I can just
ssh directly into my BeagleBone (IP over USB is found on support page as 
192.168.7.2)
$ ssh 192.168.7.2
This ssh'd me in using my default username, which I can't use to log on to
the BeagleBone, but the login prompt said what the default BeagleBone username
and password were (username: debian, password: temppwd)
$ ssh debian@192.168.7.2

Connecting to Wifi on BeagleBone:
$ sudo connmanctl
connmanctl> enable wifi
connmanctl> scan wifi
connmanctl> services
connmanctl> agent on
connmanctl> connect wifi_2cf7f10603a6_53616d73756e672047616c6178792053372035333337_managed_psk
connmanctl> quit

Installing Software on BeagleBone:
$ sudo apt-get install xauth
$ sudo apt-get install firefox-esr-l10n-en-gb
$ apt-get install openssh-server
$ apt-get install openssh-client

Server Setup:
$ ssh-keygen
	OUTPUT FOR ME:
	Generating public/private rsa key pair.
	Enter file in which to save the key (/home/debian/.ssh/id_rsa): 
	Created directory '/home/debian/.ssh'.
	Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): ****
	Enter same passphrase again: *******
	Your identification has been saved in /home/debian/.ssh/id_rsa.
	Your public key has been saved in /home/debian/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
	The key fingerprint is:
	87:e0:06:30:6e:69:23:bd:08:40:d6:e3:a7:26:36:35 debian@beaglebone
	The key's randomart image is:
	+---[RSA 2048]----+
	|oo+              |
	|oo *             |
	|o O o .          |
	|.= E + . .       |
	|. o + o S .      |
	| + o .   .       |
	|. +              |

	|                 |
	+-----------------+
$ sudo useradd -d /home/friend -m friend
$ sudo passwd friend
	Enter new UNIX password: 
	Retype new UNIX password: 
	passwd: password updated successfully
$ cd /home/friend
$ sudo mkdir .ssh
$ sudo chown -R friend .ssh
$ sudo chmod 700 .ssh

(All of this is directly from piazza and class powerpoints)
This setup process was done on both mine and my partner's beaglebone setup

Client steps:
Server: $ ifconfig
	The internet address for my BeagleBone, under wlan0, is 149.142.229.207
	The internet address for my partner's BeagleBone is 149.142.226.119
Client: $ ssh-keygen
	(Both of us had already done this, but since the step is necessary
	for connection, I include it in the log anyway)
Client: $ ssh-copy-id -i <username>@<server_ip>
	When I was client: $ ssh-copy-id -i friend@149.142.226.119
	When my partner was client: $ ssh-copy-id -i friend@149.142.229.207
Client: $ eval `ssh-agent -s`
	This step was added after some internet searching, because ssh-add 
	couldn't open a connection to the agent if the command was run on its own.
Client: $ ssh-add
	Enter passphrase for /home/debian/.ssh/id_rsa: *******
	Identity added: /home/debian/.ssh/id_rsa (/home/debian/.ssh/id_rsa)
Client: $ ssh -X friend@<server_ip>

Once connected, the client could run programs on the server, like opening a 
firefox window or adding and removing files. All that was required was running
ssh-add and entering in the passphrase associated with the client's key before
sshing into the server.
