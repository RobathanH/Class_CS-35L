5. Create Changelog:
$ emacs -nw
C-x 4 a

Adapted original changelog and wrote this, which was saved into ChangeLog:

2018-03-14  rob  <r0b@ucla.edu>
        maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'

        This is in response to a recent change in the GNU coding standards,
        which now suggest quoting 'like this' or "like this", instead of
        `like this' or ``like this''.
        This doesn't change quotes in comments!
        * src/cmp.c, src/diff.c, src/diff3.c, src/dir.c, src/sdiff.c, src/util.c
        Quote 'like this' in output

This created a new folder with a changelog
When I went into the changelog, the first entry is my entry which I created, which means it worked!
