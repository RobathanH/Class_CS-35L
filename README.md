UCLA Introductory Software Construction Lab in Winter 2018.

This is for personal reference purposes only. I strongly recommend against copying any code here.

This repo contains all the files I used for each lab project in the class. Unfortunately, these projects are not very well organized, as they all differ vastly and I did not originally intend to publish them on github. I can also no longer access the project specifications either, so many of these projects have no associated instructions.
